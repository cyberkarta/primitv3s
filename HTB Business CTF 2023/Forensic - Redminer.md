Red Miners

In the race for Vitalium on Mars, the villainous Board of Arodor resorted to desperate measures, needing funds for their mining attempts. They devised a botnet specifically crafted to mine cryptocurrency covertly. We stumbled upon a sample of Arodor's miner's installer on our server. Recognizing the gravity of the situation, we launched a thorough investigation. With you as its leader, you need to unravel the inner workings of the installation mechanism. The discovery served as a turning point, revealing the extent of Arodor's desperation. However, the battle for Vitalium continued, urging us to remain vigilant and adapt our cyber defences to counter future threats.
